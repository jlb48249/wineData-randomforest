This project is my first endeavor in machine learning, where I attempt to use a random forest regression model to predict wine quality. 

Data set can be found at http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv

To run: Open a Python editor, have Python installed, install this project's repository. 

Open the command line, run "pipenv shell" to install packages to a virtual environment (doesn't download these files to your machine but makes them accessible for this project). 

Run the script - type "python wineData.py" in the command line. 

Output should be two graphs and some measures of how good the model is. The first graph shows you the quality distribution of the data set, allowing you to check skew. The second allows you to check your predictions. 

Have fun!
